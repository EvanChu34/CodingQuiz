# CodingQuiz


Attached is the coding quiz I have worked on so far. So far the website is simple and has a few errors already. When you open the web browser you can see that all the attributes are still on one page. I will be working on that to fix it later tonight(12/3/2020). When you push the start quiz button, the question appear under the  question banner and the timer does start to count down from 60 seconds. If you get a question wrong, you get 15 seconds taken away from the overal time. The quiz works but it will not take you to another screen after it being done. The highscore function is working in a sense but it is not complete. You can submit initals, but it will not print out them on a list. 

Currently, the code is not doing what I want but is does have some operating functions. I will be continuing to work on this until this is working properly.
